Executive brief
Boeing plans to establish a global R&D hub in Nagoya focused on Sustainable Aviation Fuels. The hub will accelerate SAF technology, diversify feedstocks, scale up feedstock-to-fuel pathways, and prove commercial viability with airlines, refiners, and regulators. This case study builds a GTM plan for the hub. It breaks the plan into research outputs, pilot partnerships, commercialization steps, and market adoption policies. The plan aims to move SAFs from pilot scale to industrial supply chains that meet airline demand and regulatory targets.

Strategic goals
- Prove multiple SAF pathways at pilot and pre-commercial scale in three years.  
- Secure long-term offtake agreements with at least two major regional carriers by Year 3.  
- Achieve a 50% cost reduction target versus current small-batch production by Year 5 via process optimization and feedstock scale.  
- Establish Nagoya as a recognized SAF knowledge hub in Asia-Pacific, enabling regional policy alignment and workforce development.  
- Build a measurable pipeline of technology transfer and licensing agreements.

Scope and deliverables
- Market study and TAM estimates for SAF demand by region and by airline segment.  
- Customer segmentation and persona profiles for airlines, refiners, and integrators.  
- Competitive landscape assessment for SAF tech and supply chain.  
- A staged GTM plan that maps pilots, pilots-to-commercial transition, and scaling.  
- KPI set, dashboard templates (Excel/Power BI), and reporting cadence.  
- Risk register and mitigation matrix.  
- Financial projections for capex, opex, and revenue scenarios.  
- Slide deck and case writing templates for stakeholder briefings.  
- Playbooks for procurement, regulatory approval, and pilot execution.

Market and industry context
Sustainable Aviation Fuels face technical, commercial, and policy challenges. Demand will rise as airlines decarbonize and regulators set targets. Key drivers:
- Corporate and national net-zero targets.  
- Fuel blending mandates and credits (e.g., SAF blending obligations, tax incentives).  
- Airline commitments to use SAFs for long-haul flights and legacy fleet decarbonization.  
- Feedstock availability and sustainable sourcing concerns.

Addressable market (TAM)
We estimate regional TAM for Asia-Pacific SAFs based on flight volumes, fleet mix, and policy curves. Use simple model inputs:
- Jet fuel consumption per flight hour by aircraft type.  
- Fleet counts per carrier and route frequency.  
- Policy-driven blending targets by year.  
- Price differentials between SAF and fossil Jet-A after incentives.

Example high-level TAM result (illustrative)
- Year 1 pilot TAM: ~5k-20k tonnes/year of SAF for pilots and demonstration.  
- Year 3 commercial TAM (conservative): 200k-500k tonnes/year for regional carriers with initial blending obligations.  
- Year 5 scaled TAM: 1M+ tonnes/year as policy and offtake contracts mature.

Competitive landscape
- Technology vendors: HEFA, ATJ, FT (Fischer-Tropsch) pathways, emerging catalytic routes.  
- Refineries and converters: Major oil majors, independent bio-refiners.  
- Research centers: University labs, national research institutes across Europe, North America, and Asia.  
- Startups: Small teams with modular plants, direct air capture integration, or niche feedstock specialization.

Analyze competitors on these axes:
- Tech readiness level (TRL).  
- Cost per liter at scale.  
- Feedstock flexibility.  
- IP and patent positions.  
- Market traction and offtake agreements.
